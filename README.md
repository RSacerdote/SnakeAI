# SnakeAI

Just a simple Neural Network for the snake game in JavaScript using p5.js libraries, and genetic algorithms in order to evolve the neural network.
The .csv and .json files are the weights of an already trained AI.

# Known issues

The first food respawns at the same place as the one before and inside the snake; sometimes the food spawns at the head of the snake, going through all its body, it doens't spawn inside the body.
